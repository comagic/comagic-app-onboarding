<summary>Integration Settings (Chats)</summary> <br />

- Most settings for creating entities in chats are similar to calls, with a few key differences:
<br /><br />

  - Entities are created once per chat session, triggered by either a client or employee first message, regardless of the number of messages exchanged before the chat closes.
  <br /><br />
  - When a client sends the first message, no employee is assigned yet, so an owner can’t be set. The owner is assigned automatically by Zoho, and can be updated after an employee replies, if enabled in the integration. 
  <br /><br />
  - If the client’s phone number is hidden, entity names will contain information about this.
